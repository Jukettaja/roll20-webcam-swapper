# roll20-webcam-swapper
A Chrome Extension that moves the roll20.net webcam video feed to the top of the screen. Allows you to keep relative eye contact with your fellow players whilst looking at their webcam feeds.

## How it works

All you need to do is have the extension loaded in developer mode. Then when you are in app.roll20.net/editor/ you can click on the icon to start the browser_action that tells jQuery to run changes on the page layout so that our webcam icons are at the top of the screen.

## Missing features: 

- Options Page

- Automatically run jQuery scripts after Roll20 Loading has finished.


## Known Bugs:

Sometimes the extension icon shows up green even when the changes have not taken effect.
